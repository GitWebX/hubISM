:octocat: This is an open source android project for Hackfest 2017 called "hubISM", which serves as a solution to all the daily life problems of IIT(ISM) students. The app is being developed to be usable in even offline mode. The app follows an open-source approach for further development, in addition to what the team does itself. <br />
:metal: :tada: The app would consist of these features -

<b>1.</b>Detailed map of IIT(ISM) including all the departments , lecture halls , event locations , labs , places of interest etc.
<b>2.</b>Timetable for all the courses. (Currently for only first year students)  
<b>3.</b>Contacts containing photo &amp; contact details of all the faculty and other important persons of IIT(ISM).  
<b>4.</b>MIS hyperlink to directly access features such as attendence, grade sheet etc. (Currently opens in external browser window)<br />
<b>5.</b>Academic calender including all the vacations, exam dates &amp; other important dates.  
<b>6.</b>Clubs - this featute consists of a brief introduction of every presently active club in IIT(ISM) Dhanbad with their logos (Further plan is to include posts made on their facebook page available at a single place will be known as "Club Feed").
